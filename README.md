# Statistics Workshop: fundamentals

This repository contains material for the ["Statistics Workshop: fundamentals"](https://www.ifgoiano.edu.br/home/index.php/component/content/article/314-eventos-rioverde-pagina/26630-workshop-de-estatistica.html?Itemid=101), taught by Dr. Maria Beatriz Walter Costa (VEO Group) and organized by Prof. Dr. Heyde Fran√ßa (IF Goiano). The initiative was a joint effort between the [Viral Ecology and Omics](https://www.bio.uni-jena.de/en/2235/viral-ecology-and-omics) Group of the [Friedrich Schiller University Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/en) and the [Instituto Federal Goiano](https://www.ifgoiano.edu.br/home/index.php/rio-verde.html) (IF Goiano), Campus Rio Verde.

The target group are students and researchers of Biology and related areas who are interested in learning and discussing statistics. The workshop is 2h 30 min long and is composed of a theoretical and a practical part:

Slides of the theoretical lecture can be found in this [link](https://github.com/waltercostamb/statistics/blob/main/stats_workshop.pdf). Topics of the lecture are:

-  What is statistics?
- Types of variables
- Distributions
- Choosing tests
- Parametric test: t-test
- Non-parametric test: Mann-Whitney U test
- p-values
- Linear regression
- Correlation: Pearson
- Correlation: Spearman
- Set Enrichment Analysis
- How to continue learning

Slides of the practical exercise will be found in this [link](https://github.com/waltercostamb/statistics/blob/main/practical_exercises.pdf) after 13/12/2024. Topics of the exercise are:

- Collect data from [BacDive](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/)
- Prepare data for t-test
- Calculate: mean, standard deviation, sample size
- Calculate t-value
- Compare t-value to critical value
- Interpret results

An informative example of usage of the t-test can be found in the high-quality paper ["Evolution and host-specific adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi0908), by Weimann *et al* 2024. This paper investigates how this bacteria turned out to be a global opportunistic pathogen. Authors found that some isolates of *P. aeruginosa* have a preference for cystic-fibrosis (CF) patients and that these isolates have an increased capacity of surviving inside CF macrophages (a cell of innate immunity).

In figure 3B (above), they show in increased survival of the pathogen in CF macrophages. Wild-type *P. aeruginosa* (blue dots in the plot) have a higher survival rate after 4 hours of infection in CF macrophages (right side of plot) than in WT (non-CF) macrophages (left side of plot). This increased survival could be measured by a t-test.
