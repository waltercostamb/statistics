The target group are students and researchers of Biology and related areas who are interested in learning and discussing statistics. The workshop is 2h 30 min long and is composed of a theoretical and a practical part:

Slides of the theoretical lecture can be found in this [link](https://github.com/waltercostamb/statistics/blob/main/stats_workshop.pdf). Topics of the lecture are:

-  What is statistics?
- Types of variables
- Distributions
- Choosing tests
- Parametric test: t-test
- Non-parametric test: Mann-Whitney U test
- p-values
- Linear regression
- Correlation: Pearson
- Correlation: Spearman
- Set Enrichment Analysis
- How to continue learning

Slides of the practical exercise found in this [link](https://github.com/waltercostamb/statistics/blob/main/practical_exercises.pdf). Topics of the exercise are:

- Collect data from [BacDive](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/)
- Prepare data for t-test
- Calculate: mean, standard deviation, sample size
- Calculate t-value
- Compare t-value to critical value
- Interpret results
